logmein is a login system based on local passport authentication that manages user `registration` and `login` options. It shows a dashboard from which a user can only `logout` as this project is meant as an addition to other projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version `>=12.14.1`)
* You have installed [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/)
* You have a **Windows 10** machine. It may work on both **Linux and macOS** but they are not supported.

## Installation

To install logmein, follow these steps:

Windows:

1. Open `cmd` or `PowerShell` and run command:
```
git clone https://github.com/furiousdom/logmein.git
```

2. Change to project directory:
```
cd logmein
```

3. Install all dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Using logmein

To test logmein, run:

```
npm run dev
```

If you want to use the login system in your projects you may do so but you need to combine the two projects on your own since incorporating logmein to other projects depends from project to project.
